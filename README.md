## Projects

1. **Secure texting platform using JAVA20**
   - Description:
   - Built a secure texting platform that enables users to register, authenticate, send, and receive messages. The
platform leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, ensuring that all RESTful API
interactions are protected. Utilizing the Spring Boot framework, the application was developed with Spring MVC to handle HTTP requests
efficiently. To ensure easy deployment across different platforms, the application was encapsulated within a Docker
container. This approach simplified the deployment process and provided a consistent environment for the
application to run. Expertise in configuring Spring Security was showcased to manage JWT authentication and authorization
seamlessly, ensuring that only authenticated users could access the messaging functionalities. The testing phase of
the project utilized JUnit and Mockito, enabling rigorous unit and integration testing to validate the application's
functionality and security measures. The application's architecture relies on RESTful APIs for communication between the client and server
components, promoting a clean and modular design. This setup not only facilitates secure data exchange but also
ensures that the system remains scalable and maintainable. The combination of these technologies and
methodologies resulted in a robust and secure texting platform tailored to meet the needs of registered users.

3. **Image recognition pipeline in AWS**
   - Description:
   - Deployed two EC2 instances using Amazon Linux AMI, achieving an average uptime of 99.9% to ensure
uninterrupted parallel image processing. Instance A was configured to detect cars in images retrieved from an S3
bucket, performing object detection with a 95% accuracy rate. The detected image indexes were stored in SQS with
an average latency of less than 100ms.instance B processed these image indexes from SQS efficiently, achieving a throughput of 100 images per minute
for text recognition. This instance demonstrated a 98% accuracy rate in extracting textual information from the
images.This setup ensured a robust and efficient system for parallel image processing, leveraging AWS services to maintain
high performance and reliability.
